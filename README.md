## About

This is a simple HTML Bootstrap 4 site, that has all the exercises from [Matt D'Avella](twitter.com/mattdavella)'s video entitled ["My Morning Workout Routine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PrCie6lvY8).

I made this website because I wanted to do his workout, but I didn't want to have to check the video everytime I wanted to do it.

## Special Thanks

* **Matt D'Avella** (obviously)
* YouTube user **"Epic Interviews"** for his comment containing the whole workout. (see pic below)
* The website [Gif Run](https://gifrun.com/), which I used to make all the gifs.
